## Project Scope
### Background
Since Covid there is more demand for data and the business community having access to data to support their decision making. There are two strategic documents that this project aligns to:​

- The [Economic development strategy](https://participate.melbourne.vic.gov.au/economic-development-strategy/draft-strategy-overview) to be a **digitally connected city​**:

    - 38. Establish a City Intelligence Hub that builds on City of Melbourne’s open data platform, digitises our operations through digital twins, and models Industry 4.0 adoption. (Deliver and partner in medium timeframe.)​
    - 39. Enhance our libraries, open data platform, open innovation agenda, skills development and educational programs, and expand knowledge sharing such as Melbourne Knowledge Week festival and Melbourne Conversations events. (Deliver and partner in medium timeframe.)​
- The [draft 2021-2025 draft council plan​](https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/hdp.au.prod.app.com-participate.files/2416/2191/3903/Draft_Council_Plan_2021-2025.pdf) outlines this specific objective: "Deliver programs that will build digital literacy skills and capabilities."
### Problem statement​

> City of Melbourne has been an Australian leader in Open Data since 2014. The latest research and local user engagement has identified a gap where users would like access to Open Data example tools so that our users can re-use these tools in their apps and city solutions.​
> This project delivers a proof of concept example of how calls to Open Data API can be made to deliver a solution.
