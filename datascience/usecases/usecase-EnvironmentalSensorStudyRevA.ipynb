    "In June 2021 the Melbourne City Council endorsed it's [Economic Development Strategy 2031](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-council/vision-goals/Pages/economic-development-strategy-2031.aspx). This strategy is a plan for economic, social, and cultural recovery for the city in the ten years following the Covid-19 pandemic. The strategy introduces eight key priorities covering business, housing, health, technology, the environment, and the arts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Priority 7 is to become a digitally connected city. This priority concerns adapting to the rapidly evolving technological landscape and becoming a connected, knowledge-enabled smart city. A smart city is one which uses a range of electronic methods and sensors to collect data and inform decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Trimester 1, 2022 a data-driven study to determine the ideal locations for Green Walls around the City of Melbourne was conducted by myself and Ryan Waites on behalf of the City. One of the key findings resulting from the study was that the amount of environmental sensors currently located around the city is not enough to accurately inform decision making. This led to the ideation of this study, one to determine the ideal number of environmental sensors for the city of melbourne. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a smart city arose in the 1990s, but it was only in recent times that technology has advanced to the point where the concept can become a reality. Sensors are becoming ever [smaller and cheaper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231018306241), and computers are now powerful enough to process vast quanitites of data. Artificial Intelligence algorithms are able to analyse this data in ways that is impossible for humans, revealing insights and connections previously unthought of. The aim of this study is to support the installation of an extensive environmental sensor network that provides actionable data now and supports Melbourne's smart city data ecosystem in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the Australian Standards (AS 3580.1.1) for siting air monitoring stations specifices that they should be located more than 50 metres away from a road. I hope you agree with me dear reader that this is counterintuitive to the purpose of conducting air monitoring. To discover the effects of air quality on public health we should aim to establish the level of exposure people are having to various pollutants on a daily basis. The only time that someone outdoors in the Melbourne CBD is more than 50m away from a road is when they are in a park. Most people outdoors are not in parks. Many people enjoy outdoor dining at locations less than one metre away from a road on a daily basis! \n",
