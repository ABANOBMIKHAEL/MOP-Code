    "We want to optimize waste collection routes for smart bins,\n",
    "\n",
    "So that we can efficiently collect waste from these bins while minimizing fuel consumption, reducing traffic congestion, and lowering operational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceptance Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Efficient Route Planning: The solution should provide optimized routes for waste collection vehicles to pick up waste from smart bins across different areas of Melbourne.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Real-time Data Integration: The system should integrate real-time data from smart bins to dynamically adjust collection routes based on current fill levels and demand patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Minimize Environmental Impact: The optimized routes should aim to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by minimizing travel distance and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Traffic Congestion Reduction: The solution should consider traffic patterns and congestion hotspots to avoid delays and optimize route efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Cost-effectiveness: The optimized routes should minimize operational costs associated with waste collection, including labor, fuel, and vehicle maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Scalability: The solution should be scalable to accommodate the growing number of smart bins and evolving waste collection needs in Melbourne.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.User-Friendly Interface: The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing waste management authorities to easily visualize and manage waste collection routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8Compliance: The solution should adhere to local regulations and guidelines related to waste collection and transportation in Melbourne.}"

    "### Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "For styling within your markdown cells, there are two choices you can use for headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can use HTML classes specific to the use case styling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-header\">This is a subsection header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;\">This is a subsection header.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```<p class=\"usecase-subsection-blurb\">This is a blurb header.</p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em; font-style:italic;\">This is a blurb header.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Or if you like you can use the markdown header styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```# for h1```\n",
    "\n",
    "```## for h2```\n",
    "\n",
    "```### for h3```\n",

    "## Plot colour schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "General advice:\n",
    "1. Use the same colour or colour palette throughout your notebook, unless variety is necessary\n",
    "2. Select a palette based on the type of data being represented\n",
    "3. Consider accessibility (colourblindness, low vision)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) If all of your plots only use 1-2 colors use one of the company style colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Light theme | Dark Theme |\n",
    "|-----|-----|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#2af598;\">#2af598</p>|<p style=\"color:#08af64;\">#08af64</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#22e4ac;\">#22e4ac</p>|<p style=\"color:#14a38e;\">#14a38e</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#1bd7bb;\">#1bd7bb</p>|<p style=\"color:#0f9295;\">#0f9295</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#14c9cb;\">#14c9cb</p>|<p style=\"color:#056b8a;\">#056b8a</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#0fbed8;\">#0fbed8</p>|<p style=\"color:#121212;\">#121212</p>|\n",
    "|<p style=\"color:#08b3e5;\">#08b3e5</p>||\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) If your plot needs multiple colors, choose an appropriate palette using either of the following tutorials:\n",
    "- https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html\n",
    "- https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Consider accessibility as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For qualitative plotting Seaborn's 'colorblind' palette is recommended. For maps with sequential or diverging it is recommended to use one of the Color Brewer schemes which can be previewed at https://colorbrewer2.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to design your own colour scheme, it should use the same principles as Cynthia Brewer's research (with variation not only in hue but also, saturation or luminance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to acknowledge your sources and any attributions using links or a reference list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have quite a few references, you might wish to have a dedicated section for references at the end of your document, linked using footnote style numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can connect your in-text reference by adding the number with a HTML link: ```<a href=\"#fn-1\">[1]</a>```\n",
    "\n",
    "and add a matching ID in the reference list using the ```<fn>``` tag: ```<fn id=\"fn-1\">[1] Author (Year) _Title_, Publisher, Publication location.</fn>```"
