		<p style="text-align: justify;">The box plots of minimum temperature by month show a clear trend between each month.  The coldest minimum temperatures as expected in Winter (June, July and August) and the hottest minimum temperatures in Summer (Especially January and February).  What is interesting is visually confirming the outliers that were suspected in the previous graph.  There are three minimum outliers in July whilst there are many more maximum outliers throughout the year (especially in the summer months).  This may suggest more heat events (heat waves) than cold ones. </p>
