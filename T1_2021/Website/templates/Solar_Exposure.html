		<h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Exploratory Data Analysis on Solar Exposure</p></h2>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this page is to explore the trends in one of the predictor variables the solar exposure, we believe this variable impacts pedestrian count which our client intends to make appropriate decisions to promote. The cumulative amount of solar energy that falls on a horizontal surface is referred to as the global solar exposure. Daily global sun exposure is the cumulative amount of solar energy received during a single day. Regular global exposure levels are usually between 1 and 35MJ/m2 (megajoules per square metre). For mid-latitudes, values are typically higher during summer's bright sun and lowest during winter or very cloudy days. The Dataset was sourced from the bureau of metrology website. The data from BOM website ranges from 1990 to date however we are only considering a subset of the dataset from 2015 to date as one of our predictor variables.</p>
