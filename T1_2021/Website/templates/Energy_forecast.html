	<h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Exploratory Data Analysis on Recommended Retail Price</p></h2>  
	<div>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Below are various graphs to help interpret the trends of the predictor variable “Recommended Retail Price” (RRP). Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) manages the electricity distribution across Australia, helping to ensure Australians have access to affordable and reliable energy. RRP is the Australian recommended retail price of the electricity per megawatt, which AEMO sets. The RRP value changes on a half-hourly basis. From the below graph, it can be seen that the RRP was negative during some intervals of the day. This means the energy producers were paying consumers rather than vice versa. The COVID-19 lockdown and work-from-home restrictions during the pandemic have increased the energy consumption and the retail price of electricity.</p>
