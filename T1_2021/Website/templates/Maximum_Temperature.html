		<h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Exploratory Data Analysis on Maximum Temperature</p></h2>
	
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Below are various graphs to help interpret what is happening to the predictor variable “Maximum Temperature”.  We believe that maximum temperature affects how many people will be in the city (the variable to which we want to find out).  In the first scatter plot maximum temperature tends to follow a sin trend but heavily weighted towards maximum values.  To find out more the box plots by month shows this in detail.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">The box plots of maximum temperature by month show a clear trend between each month.  What is interesting to note is that there are large maximum whiskers meaning that there are quite large temperature variations leaning towards the hotter side.  For example, in January one quarter of the temperatures lie between 30 °C and 43 °C.  This confirms the observation from the previous graph that there is a skew towards higher temperatures, which may suggest that heatwaves are frequent.  </p>

	<div>
		
		<p style="text-align: justify;">When looking at the histogram it is clear that our observations from the previous two graphs are substantiated.  With a skew of 0.86 this shows the clear skew towards higher temperatures.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">The prediction neatly follows the same trend as the actual values.  As such it will be reliable when calculating the pedestrian counts. </p>
