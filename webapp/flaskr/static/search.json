I would like to know where similar businesses are located and the density of residents and office workers in comparison. I want to know the number of seats I should provide based on seating capacity at other similar establishments in the same area and understand how this may have changed over time. If on street or off-street parking is available nearby this may help me decide where to locate my venue.",
